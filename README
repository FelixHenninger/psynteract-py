# Psynteract Python bindings

__Real-time interactive experiments for the behavioral sciences, using Python.__

This package allows researchers to build real-time interactive experiments in pure Python. If you are using [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org), [expyriment](http://www.expyriment.org/) or a similar package to build your studies, this is for you.<br>
If you would like to get started as quickly as possible, please download the [latest release](releases) and add the psynteract directory to your project folder.

Finally, just to be sure, please note that a [graphical interface for OpenSesame](https://github.com/felixhenninger/psynteract-os) is also available.

## Status
This software is currently in early beta: Most core functionality is present and relatively stable. Additional features will be added and internal changes are likely.

Comments, suggestions, and pull requests are very welcome.
