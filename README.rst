Psynteract Python bindings
==========================

**Real-time interactive experiments for the behavioral sciences, using
Python.**

This package allows researchers to build real-time interactive experiments in
pure Python. If you are using `PsychoPy <http://www.psychopy.org>`__,
`expyriment <http://www.expyriment.org/>`__ or a similar package to build your
studies and are studying strategic interactions or another paradigm that
requires that participants interact in real time, this is for you.

Please note that a `graphical interface for OpenSesame
<https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-os>`__ is also available.

----

``psynteract-py`` is developed jointly by **Felix Henninger** and **Pascal
Kieslich**. It is published under the `Apache License, Version 2.0 </LICENSE>`__.

This software is stable and has been successfully used in several studies across
multiple labs. Additional features will be added, radical changes are not
currently planned.

Comments, suggestions, and pull requests are always very welcome -- please do
not hesitate to let the authors know if we can help in any way!

Installation
------------

The package can be installed locally via the ``pip`` command, specifying the
latest release URL, such as::

    pip install https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py/releases/download/v0.9.0/psynteract-0.9.0.tar.gz

The psynteract library should then be available within the local python
installation.

To install the latest development version, please run::

    pip install git+https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py.git

Please note that the `psynteract backend
<https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-backend>`__, which is bundled with
the releases, needs to be downloaded and installed separately if you would like
to use the backend installation function from the library.
