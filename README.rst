Psynteract Python bindings
==========================

**Real-time interactive experiments for the behavioral sciences, using
Python.**

This package allows researchers to build real-time interactive
experiments in pure Python. If you are using
`PsychoPy <http://www.psychopy.org>`__,
`expyriment <http://www.expyriment.org/>`__ or a similar package to
build your studies, this is for you. If you would like to get started as
quickly as possible, please download the `latest
release <https://github.com/psynteract/psynteract-py/releases>`__ and
add the psynteract directory to your project folder.

Finally, just to be sure, please note that a `graphical interface for
OpenSesame <https://github.com/felixhenninger/psynteract-os>`__ is also
available.

Status
------

This software is currently in early beta: Most core functionality is
present and relatively stable. Additional features will be added and
internal changes are likely.

Comments, suggestions, and pull requests are very welcome!
